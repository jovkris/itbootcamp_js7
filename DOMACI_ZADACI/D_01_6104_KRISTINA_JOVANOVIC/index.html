        Hello everyone, I'm Kristina, but you can call me <b>Tina</b>. I come from Nis, and I'm too lazy to type in
        Serbian so I decided to write in, <i>y'all guessed it</i>, ENGLISH! <br><br>I'm gonna list some things about me
        here, feel free to actually read it.
    </p>

            So, I like a bunch of things, and I can't even name them all, but here are some honorable mentions in no
            particular order:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Sports (all of them, not watching, just playing)
            </li>

            <li>
                Listening to and playing music (fun fact, i used to be a dj)
            </li>

            <li>Watching scary movies</li>

            <li>Reading about science</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Currently, I just have one hobby, and that's going to the <span>gym</span> to exercise. Apart from that, in
            my free time I like to enrich my friends' lives by sending them memes and scaring my dog makes me happy.
